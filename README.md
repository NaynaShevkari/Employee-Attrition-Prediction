# Employee Attrition Prediction

A machine learning project to predict employee attrition using classification models, based on HR analytics data. The goal is to identify key factors contributing to employee turnover and build predictive models that can assist HR departments in decision-making.


## Overview

- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand employee behavior and trends.
- Handled missing values, outliers, and applied feature encoding and scaling.
- Built and evaluated models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, KNN, XGBoost, and SVM.
- Assessed models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix, and ROC-AUC.
- Identified top features contributing to attrition using feature importance techniques.

## Tools & Libraries

- Python, Jupyter Notebook  
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn  
- scikit-learn, xgboost  

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository  
2. Open `attrition_model.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook
